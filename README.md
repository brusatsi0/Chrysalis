Chrysalis bundle for Keyboard.io
================================

A heavy work in progress. Don't expect anything fancy. Or friendly. Yet.

To launch the development environment, simply type `yarn && yarn start`.

Please make sure you have a firmware with [bi-directional communication][plugin:FocusSerial] and [EEPROMKeymap][plugin:eepromkeymap] enabled. The latest beta (v1.93-beta) of the [factory firmware][factory-firmware], or its latest master branch might be a good starting point.

 [plugin:FocusSerial]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/doc/plugin/FocusSerial.md
 [plugin:eepromkeymap]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope/blob/master/doc/plugin/EEPROM-Keymap.md
