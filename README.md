=============

This is a collection of libraries to make it easier to work with keyboards that support [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope]'s [Focus][kaleidoscope:focus] protocol.

```javascript
import Focus from "@chrysalis-api/focus";
import { Model01 } from "@chrysalis-api/hardware-keyboardio-model01";

let focus = new Focus();
focus.open(Model01).then(() => {
  focus.command("help").then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
  });
});
