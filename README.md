Chrysalis bundle for Keyboard.io
================================

A heavy work in progress. Don't expect anything fancy. Or friendly. Yet.

To launch the development environment, simply type `yarn && yarn start`.

Please make sure you've got the latest firmware from https://github.com/keyboardio/Model01-Firmware (at least v1.22 is required for communication with your keyboard)
