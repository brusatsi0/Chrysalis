     * matching ones. Each argument must be an object with an `usb` property,

     * will match these with USB devices on the system, and return a list of
     * matches.
     *
     * For example, a `device` descriptor may look like this:
     * ```json
     * const Model01 = {
     *   usb: {
     *     vendorId: 0x1209,
     *     productId: 0x2301

     *   keyboard: {
     *     rows: 4,
     *     columns: 16
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @param {DEVICE} devices - List of supported, or sought-after devices.
     *
     * @returns {Promise<Array>} A list of port descriptors for matching
     * devices.
