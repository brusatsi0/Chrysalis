Chrysalis 0.2.0
===============
Released on 2018-12-31

## Hardware support

Chrysalis now supports the [Atreus][atreus] keyboard, when it is running a
Chrysalis-enabled [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope] firmware. We ship with
[one][chrysalis-bundle:atreus], just in case.

 [atreus]: https://atreus.technomancy.us/
 [kaleidoscope]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope
 [chrysalis-bundle:atreus]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis-Firmware-Bundle/tree/master/Technomancy/Atreus

Chrysalis also has preliminary support for [Dygma Raise][raise] - it should
work, but it is untested on real hardware at this time.

## UI/UX changes

* The dropdown on the keyboard selection page will now list not only the ports,
  but which keyboard they belong to, too.
* The previous "Information" page was replaced by a bottom bar, providing the
  same functionality, in a more accessible place.
