Nevertheless, updating the firmware will overwrite the previous one. If you customised your firmware, make sure you're flashing one that you are comfortable with. If you wish to proceed, please consult the documentation of your keyboard to see how to enable uploading new firmware, and then press the {0} button to continue.`,
